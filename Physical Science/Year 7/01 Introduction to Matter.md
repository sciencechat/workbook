# 1 Introduction to Matter

## 1.1 Describing Matter

### What Properties Describe Matter?
Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. It can be described using its physical and chemical properties. Physical properties include characteristics such as color, density, and state (solid, liquid, or gas), while chemical properties describe a substance's ability to change into different substances.

### Substances
A substance is a single kind of matter that is pure, meaning it has a specific composition and set of properties. Examples include table salt (sodium chloride) and water (H₂O).

### Physical and Chemical Properties of Matter
- **Physical properties**: Characteristics of a substance that can be observed without changing it into another substance (e.g., hardness, melting point, boiling point).
- **Chemical properties**: Characteristics that describe a substance's ability to change into different substances (e.g., flammability, rusting of iron).

## 1.2 Classifying Matter

### Vocabulary
- **Element**: A pure substance that cannot be broken down into any other substances by chemical or physical means.
- **Compound**: A pure substance made of two or more elements chemically combined in a set ratio.
- **Mixture**: Two or more substances that are mixed together but not chemically combined.

### What Is Matter Made Of?
Matter is made of particles called atoms. Different kinds of atoms combine to form different substances.

### Elements
Elements are the simplest substances. Each element is made up of only one kind of atom. For example, gold is made up of only gold atoms.

### Atoms
Atoms are the basic particles from which all elements are made. The structure of atoms is key to understanding matter's behavior.

#### Atoms and Molecules
Atoms can combine to form molecules. For example, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to form a water molecule (H₂O).

### Compounds
Compounds are substances formed by the chemical combination of two or more elements in a specific ratio. For example, water (H₂O) is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen.

### What Are Two Types of Mixtures?

#### Heterogeneous Mixtures
In a heterogeneous mixture, you can see the different parts. For example, in a salad, you can see the lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers.

#### Homogeneous Mixtures
In a homogeneous mixture, the substances are so evenly mixed that you cannot see the different parts. An example is saltwater.

#### Separating Mixtures
Mixtures can be separated into their components using physical methods such as filtration, distillation, or evaporation.

## 1.3 Measuring Matter

### What Units Are Used to Express Mass and Volume?
- **Mass** is the amount of matter in an object and is measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).
- **Volume** is the amount of space that matter occupies and is measured in liters (L) or cubic centimeters (cm³).

### Weight
Weight is the force of gravity on an object and is measured in newtons (N). It can vary depending on the strength of the gravitational field.

### Mass
Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. Unlike weight, mass does not change regardless of location.

### Volume
Volume is the amount of space that an object or substance occupies. It can be measured using formulas or water displacement.

### Calculating Volume
For regular objects, volume can be calculated using geometric formulas. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is found using:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
\]

### Measuring Irregular Objects
The volume of irregular objects can be measured using water displacement. The object is submerged in water, and the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the object.

### How Is Density Determined?
Density is the mass of a material in a given volume. It is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
\]

### Calculating Density
Density is typically expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). For example, if an object has a mass of 50 grams and a volume of 25 cm³, its density is:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{50 \text{g}}{25 \text{cm³}} = 2 \text{g/cm³}
\]

### Sinking or Floating?
An object will sink if its density is greater than the density of the liquid it is placed in. It will float if its density is less.

### Using Density
Density is useful in identifying substances and predicting whether an object will float or sink in a given liquid.

## 1.4 Changes in Matter

### What Happens to a Substance in a Physical Change?
A physical change alters the form or appearance of matter but does not turn any substance in the matter into a different substance. Examples include changes in state (solid, liquid, gas), shape, or size.

### Changes of State
Matter can change from one state to another when thermal energy is added or removed. Examples include melting, freezing, vaporization, and condensation.

### Changes in Shape or Form
Physical changes can also involve changes in the shape or form of a substance, such as cutting, crushing, or bending.

### What Happens to a Substance in a Chemical Change?
A chemical change, or chemical reaction, occurs when a substance is transformed into a different substance with different properties. Examples include rusting, burning, and decomposing.

### Examples of Chemical Change
- **Burning wood**: Produces ash, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.
- **Rusting iron**: Iron combines with oxygen to form rust (iron oxide).

### Conservation of Mass
The law of conservation of mass states that matter is not created or destroyed in any chemical or physical change. The mass of the reactants equals the mass of the products.

### How Are Changes in Energy and Matter Related?
Energy changes accompany physical and chemical changes. In a chemical change, energy is either absorbed (endothermic) or released (exothermic).

### Temperature and Thermal Energy
- **Temperature**: A measure of the average energy of motion of the particles of a substance.
- **Thermal energy**: The total energy of all the particles in a substance.

### Thermal Energy and Changes in Matter
Thermal energy can cause changes in matter, such as melting or boiling. When thermal energy is added to a substance, its particles move faster, which can cause a change in state.

### Transforming Chemical Energy
Chemical reactions can also transform chemical energy stored in bonds into other forms of energy, such as thermal energy or light.
