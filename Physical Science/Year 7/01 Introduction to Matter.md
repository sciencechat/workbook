# Introduction to Matter

## What is Matter?

Matter is everything around us. Anything that has mass and takes up space is considered matter. From the air we breathe to the chair we sit on, matter makes up all the substances in the universe.

### Characteristics of Matter

- **Mass:** Mass is the amount of material in an object. It is measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). Mass is a property that doesn’t change based on location—whether you are on Earth, the moon, or in space, your mass remains the same.
  
- **Volume:** Volume is the amount of space an object occupies. Solids, liquids, and gases all have volume, though it may be measured differently. The volume of a solid is typically measured in cubic centimeters (cm³), while liquids are measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL).
  
- **States of Matter:** Matter exists in different forms or states. The three primary states of matter are:
  
  1. **Solids** – In a solid, particles are tightly packed together and vibrate in place. Solids have a definite shape and volume.
  
  2. **Liquids** – In a liquid, particles are still close together but can move past each other. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container.
  
  3. **Gases** – In a gas, particles move freely and spread out to fill the space they are in. Gases have neither a definite shape nor volume.

There are other states of matter like **plasma** and **Bose-Einstein condensates**, but we will focus on solids, liquids, and gases for now.

## The Particle Model of Matter

The particle model explains the structure and behavior of matter. According to this model, all matter is made up of tiny particles (atoms and molecules) that are in constant motion. How these particles interact determines the state of the matter.

- In **solids**, particles are packed closely and vibrate in place.
- In **liquids**, particles are still close but can slide past one another.
- In **gases**, particles move quickly and are spread far apart.

### Changes in States of Matter

Matter can change from one state to another when energy is added or removed. These changes in state include:

- **Melting** – Solid to liquid (e.g., ice to water).
- **Freezing** – Liquid to solid (e.g., water to ice).
- **Evaporation** – Liquid to gas (e.g., water to steam).
- **Condensation** – Gas to liquid (e.g., steam to water).
- **Sublimation** – Solid to gas without passing through the liquid state (e.g., dry ice turning into carbon dioxide gas).

The key factor in changing states is energy, usually in the form of heat. As you add energy, particles move faster, and as you remove energy, particles slow down.

## Importance of Matter

Understanding matter is fundamental to the study of science. Everything, from the smallest atom to the largest galaxy, is made of matter. By studying matter, scientists learn how the universe works at both small and large scales.
