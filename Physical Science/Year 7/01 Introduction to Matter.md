# 01 Introduction to Matter

## What is Matter?

Matter is everything around us. Anything that has mass and takes up space is considered matter. From the air we breathe to the chair we sit on, matter makes up all the substances in the universe.

### Characteristics of Matter

- **Mass:** Mass is the amount of material in an object. It is measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). Mass is a property that doesn’t change based on location—whether you are on Earth, the moon, or in space, your mass remains the same.
  
- **Volume:** Volume is the amount of space an object occupies. Solids, liquids, and gases all have volume, though it may be measured differently. The volume of a solid is typically measured in cubic centimeters (cm³), while liquids are measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL).
  
- **States of Matter:** Matter exists in different forms or states. The three primary states of matter are:
  
  1. **Solids** – In a solid, particles are tightly packed together and vibrate in place. Solids have a definite shape and volume.
  
  2. **Liquids** – In a liquid, particles are still close together but can move past each other. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container.
  
  3. **Gases** – In a gas, particles move freely and spread out to fill the space they are in. Gases have neither a definite shape nor volume.

There are other states of matter like **plasma** and **Bose-Einstein condensates**, but we will focus on solids, liquids, and gases for now.

## The Particle Model of Matter

The particle model explains the structure and behavior of matter. According to this model, all matter is made up of tiny particles (atoms and molecules) that are in constant motion. How these particles interact determines the state of the matter.

- In **solids**, particles are packed closely and vibrate in place.
- In **liquids**, particles are still close but can slide past one another.
- In **gases**, particles move quickly and are spread far apart.

### Changes in States of Matter

Matter can change from one state to another when energy is added or removed. These changes in state include:

- **Melting** – Solid to liquid (e.g., ice to water).
- **Freezing** – Liquid to solid (e.g., water to ice).
- **Evaporation** – Liquid to gas (e.g., water to steam).
- **Condensation** – Gas to liquid (e.g., steam to water).
- **Sublimation** – Solid to gas without passing through the liquid state (e.g., dry ice turning into carbon dioxide gas).

The key factor in changing states is energy, usually in the form of heat. As you add energy, particles move faster, and as you remove energy, particles slow down.

## Importance of Matter

Understanding matter is fundamental to the study of science. Everything, from the smallest atom to the largest galaxy, is made of matter. By studying matter, scientists learn how the universe works at both small and large scales.

Ever stop to think that, like everything around us, this

Unknown 0:02
microphone, the

Unknown 0:03
chair I'm sinking into, even that cup of coffee in your hand, it's

Unknown 0:06
all when you really get down to it made

Unknown 0:07
of the same stuff, right? We call it matter. And today we're diving deep into what matter is, why

Unknown 0:13
it matters, pun intended,

Unknown 0:15
and maybe uncover a few

Unknown 0:18
what moments along the way, and get this, the same rules that apply to the ice clinking in your glass, they apply to a distant star exploding light years away. It's all like governed by the principles of matter. Okay, that's

Unknown 0:30
kind of mind blowing when you put it like that. But let's start simple. What

Unknown 0:34
is matter? Exactly at

Unknown 0:36
its core, Matter is anything, anything at all, that has mass and takes up space.

Unknown 0:41
So it's not just the things we can like, see and touch, right? What about like, the

Unknown 0:45
air we breathe? Absolutely

Unknown 0:46
air, even though can't see it is definitely matter. It's got mass. It takes up space, and you can feel it when the wind blows. And just like that invisible air, even those mind bogglingly massive black holes scatter throughout the universe, they're considered matter. Okay,

Unknown 1:02
I'm starting to see how vast this whole matter thing is.

Unknown 1:05
You mentioned mass and volume. What do those really mean? Good

Unknown 1:09
point. It's easy to throw around those sciency words, but understanding them is key. Mass is essentially how much stuff an object has, and we measure it in grams or kilograms. Think of it this way, your mass doesn't change whether you're here on earth or bouncing around on the moon.

Unknown 1:27
So the reading on my scale might be different on the moon, but I'm still made of the same amount of me exactly.

Unknown 1:31
It's just that the force of gravity acting on your mass is different in those environments. Now volume. Volume is about how much space an object takes up. Think of a picture of iced tea, the amount of liquid it holds. That's its volume. Got

Unknown 1:45
it so mass is like how much stuff and volume is how much space that stuff takes up. But matter can exist in so many different forms. I mean, my coffee's liquid, my desk is solid. The air around us is a gas. What's going on there? You're hitting on the

Unknown 1:58
different states of matter. You've got your classic trio solids, liquids and gasses. Each state is defined by how its particles are arranged and how much they move around.

Unknown 2:07
Okay, so it's like the difference between ice melting into water and then boiling away into steam. But wait, you're telling me there are more states of matter than just those three. You're

Unknown 2:17
right. There's there's more to the matter story than that meets the eye. We also have more exotic states, like plasma. Think of the scorching surface of the sun, and then there are things like Bose Einstein condensates, which exist at extremely low temperatures. But let's, let's stick with our everyday solids, liquids and gasses for now,

Unknown 2:37
that's probably a good idea. My brain might explode if we go full on quantum physics right now. But back to the basics. What actually makes a salt, a solid, a liquid, a

Unknown 2:46
liquid. You know, it all boils down to how those tiny particles that make up matter are arranged and how much they're moving. Imagine a crowded dance floor in a solid. The particles are packed in tight, vibrating, but not really going anywhere. It's like everyone's doing the Jitterbug in slow motion, but they're crammed in so tightly they can barely move. Okay,

Unknown 3:06
I can picture that. So are the particles in a liquid doing the tango. Then more

Unknown 3:09
like a graceful waltz. They've got a bit more freedom to move around each other, which is why liquids can flow and take the shape of whatever container you put them in. That makes sense. And a gas, I bet those particles are having a wild party. You got it? Gas particles are like a room full of bouncy puppies. They're moving around freely bouncing off each other in the walls, spreading out to fill whatever space they're in. I'm

Unknown 3:32
loving these analogies. So we've got solids doing the Jitterbug liquids waltzing, and gas is like a puppy party. But how did things switch between these states, like, what makes my ice cube melt into a puddle

Unknown 3:44
that my friend is all about energy, usually in the form of heat. Adding energy makes those tiny particles move faster and faster. Ah,

Unknown 3:53
so when I crank up the heat on my stove, those water molecules start getting their groove on, and eventually they're moving so fast that they just turn into steam Exactly.

Unknown 4:01
Adding heat increases their kinetic energy, making them break free from their rigid structure and transition into a different state. And when you remove energy, say, by sticking that pot of water in the freezer, things slow down, and you eventually get back to solid ice. So

Unknown 4:16
energy is like the DJ of the matter world, setting the vibe for the whole party. I'm starting to see how this all fits together. That's

Unknown 4:23
a great way to put it. Energy, yeah, energy definitely calls the shots when it comes to the state matter takes and speaking of Energy, did you know that your phone right there in your hand? It's a testament to our understanding of matter and energy. Wait,

Unknown 4:37
really, what

Unknown 4:38
does my phone have to do with all of this. Think about it.

Unknown 4:41
Your phones like sleek design, that crystal clear screen, the powerful little processor that runs it all. That's all thanks to material scientists. They use their knowledge of matter to select and manipulate materials, like at the atomic and molecular level.

Unknown 4:56
You mean, someone chose the materials for my phone. I. Based on how their atoms and molecules behave precisely,

Unknown 5:02
they consider things like conductivity, durability, even how those materials interact with light and heat. It's like choosing the right dancers for a complex choreography. Each material has its own like, unique properties that make it suitable for specific roles. You know, within your phone, wow. I

Unknown 5:22
had no idea so much science went into designing something I use every single day. So it's not just about gadgets, though, right? Not

Unknown 5:28
at all, yeah, this deep understanding of matter, it's behind so many amazing things we're talking about, like engineering bridges that can withstand incredible stress, creating life saving medications, developing new sources of clean energy. Oh, I

Unknown 5:41
get it. Understanding matter is crucial for, you know, advancing technology and tackling some of the world's biggest challenges. But

Unknown 5:47
how does this impact me? Personally,

Unknown 5:49
I'm not exactly building bridges or designing the next generation of smartphones. Understanding

Unknown 5:54
matter. Well, it isn't just about building things right? It's about understanding how the world around you works. It's about being able to answer those why questions that pop into your head, why does ice float? How does your microwave heat up food? Why can't you walk through walls?

Unknown 6:10
Those are actually really good questions. I've

Unknown 6:12
never stopped to think about them before. That's

Unknown 6:13
what's so exciting. Knowing a bit about matter, it unlocks a whole new level of curiosity. You start to see the world through a different lens, appreciating the intricate dance of particles that underpins our reality, and central to that dance are the stars of the show atoms and molecules.

Unknown 6:33
Right earlier, we were talking about those tiny particles that make up matter, didn't you call them like the building blocks of matter?

Unknown 6:38
Exactly, think back to our dance floor analogy. If the dance floor represents, you know, matter as a whole, atoms and molecules, those are the individual dancers. So

Unknown 6:48
when we talk about things changing state, like ice melting, we're really talking about those atoms and molecules changing their dance moves precisely.

Unknown 6:55
They're still the same, adders and molecules just moving differently in response to changes in energy. It's like the music changed and now they're grooving to a different beat. Remember, adding energy makes them move faster, while removing energy slows them down.

Unknown 7:10
This is all starting to make so much more sense now. But how do we even know all this about atoms and molecules? I mean, they're like way too small to see with our naked eyes. Did someone actually see an atom that,

Unknown 7:23
my friend, is a fascinating story for another deep dive. Let's just say that scientists are incredibly clever and have come up with some ingenious ways to study the universe, even the parts we can't see directly. But for now, let's get back to those exotic states of matter you mentioned earlier, plasma and those Einstein condensates we only had a chance to like scratch the surface before.

Unknown 7:43
Oh yes, those sounded seriously cool and little mind boggling. If I'm being honest, I remember you comparing plasma to something like the surface of the sun,

Unknown 7:52
exactly. Plasma is like matter on overdrive. Imagine a state of matter so hot that atoms start to lose some of their components, becoming a sort of superheated soup of charged particles. We call this process ionization, and it's what gives plasma its unique properties. It's not your everyday state of matter. You'll find plasma in things like stars lightning, and even those vibrant neon signs you see downtown. Wow.

Unknown 8:16
Okay, stars, lightning, neon signs, now that's what I call exotic. But what about those Bose Einstein condensates that name sounds like it's straight out of Star

Unknown 8:25
Trek. It does have a certain ring to it, doesn't it? Imagine this a state of matter where atoms get so incredibly cool, we're talking just a hair's breadth above absolute zero, that they practically lose their individual identities and merge into a single entity. They start behaving less like individual particles and more like a unified wave.

Unknown 8:44
Wait, so instead of like billions of individual atoms, it's like they're all acting as one. What does that even look like? That's the

Unknown 8:50
thing. It's not something you can easily observe with your eyes, but the way they behave fascinating. Imagine a substance that can flow without any resistance, a superfluid that's the kind of like bizarre behavior you see with Bose Einstein condensates all thanks to the mind bending world of quantum mechanics. Okay,

Unknown 9:09
you've officially lost me at quantum mechanics. But it sounds like we've gone from the familiar comfort of my morning coffee to the fiery heart of a star and now to the edge of like quantum weirdness. It's incredible to think about the sheer range of what matter can do.

Unknown 9:26
And the truly mind blowing thing is that even with all we've discovered, we're still just scratching the surface of what there is to learn about matter. There's still so many unanswered questions, so many mysteries to unravel, I can only

Unknown 9:37
imagine, but I have to ask, with all this talk about states of matter, atoms, the mysteries of the universe. What's the takeaway here?

Unknown 9:45
Why does understanding all of this matter? That's

Unknown 9:47
the million dollar question, isn't it, and the answer is both incredibly simple and mind bogglingly profound. All

Unknown 9:54
right. All right. You've got me on the edge of my seat here. You were about to tell me why understanding all of this. Yeah. Well, it matters.

Unknown 10:01
It's simple really, understanding matter. It's the key to understanding, well, everything, the entire universe, from the smallest, tiniest grain of sand to the most distant galaxy, it's all made of matter, all interacting based on these same fundamental principles. Okay, that's

Unknown 10:18
a pretty big statement. I

Unknown 10:19
get that it's important for science, for technology, but you're saying it goes

Unknown 10:23
even deeper than that. Absolutely.

Unknown 10:24
Think about something like, oh, I don't know, baking a cake, you're combining ingredients, applying heat, causing chemical reactions. You're essentially, like, manipulating matter to create something totally new. And it's not just cakes, it's the air we breathe, the food we eat even the very process of life itself. Wow,

Unknown 10:42
when you put it that way, it

Unknown 10:44
really does seem like matter is at the heart of, well, everything

Unknown 10:47
exactly understanding matter, it empowers us to solve problems, to create new technologies, to make, you know, informed decisions about our world. It's about pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and really pushing the limits of what we think is possible.

Unknown 11:01
So by understanding the smallest building blocks of the universe, we can make a real difference in the bigger picture. That's that's pretty inspiring. Actually, it is inspiring.

Unknown 11:11
And the most exciting part, we're still just getting started. There are still so many questions out there, so many mysteries to unravel, like, what is matter really, at the most like fundamental level, what are the limits of how we can manipulate it? Can we create entirely new states of matter with properties we can't even begin to imagine? Whoa,

Unknown 11:30
you're really making me think it's amazing to consider all the things we still don't know about the world around us.

Unknown 11:36
And that's the beauty of science, right? It's a journey, a constant journey of discovery. Every answer just leads to more questions, pushing us to delve deeper, to explore further.

Unknown 11:47
Well said well said. So to our listeners, as you go about your day, take a moment, just one moment, to appreciate the wonder of matter all around you, from a cup of coffee in your hand to the screen you're watching this on, it's all connected by the same incredible principles we've been kind of leaking out on today. And who knows, maybe one of you listening will be the one to make the next big breakthrough in our understanding of the universe. Until next time, keep those minds curious.
