To display mathematical equations like Newton's Second Law properly in Markdown on GitHub, you need to use an image or GitHub's built-in support for simple inline mathematical expressions, as GitHub doesn't fully support LaTeX or MathJax directly in Markdown. However, there are a couple of options to show equations effectively:

### Option 1: Use an Image of the Equation

You can create an image of the equation and then embed it into your markdown. Here's how you can include an image of the equation:

```markdown
Newton’s Second Law relates force, mass, and acceleration. It can be expressed as:

![Newton's Second Law](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F%20%3D%20ma)

This means that the acceleration of an object depends on the force applied to it and its mass.
```

This uses an external LaTeX rendering service like [Codecogs](https://latex.codecogs.com/) to create an image of the formula, which is embedded as an image in your markdown.

### Option 2: Simplified Plain Text

For simpler representations, you can just use plain text with basic symbols:

```markdown
Newton’s Second Law relates force, mass, and acceleration. It can be expressed as:

`Force (F) = mass (m) × acceleration (a)`

This means that the acceleration of an object depends on the force applied to it and its mass.
```

While this doesn't look as polished as LaTeX, it works in GitHub Markdown.

### Option 3: Using KaTeX in GitHub Pages or Jupyter Notebooks

If you're hosting your markdown on a GitHub Pages site (or using it in a Jupyter Notebook), you can use KaTeX or MathJax for full LaTeX rendering by adding the necessary libraries to your HTML.

For standard markdown in repositories, the image option is the most practical.
